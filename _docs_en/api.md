> **No assumptions**
>
> At any time, do not assume that the returned data is complete, or make assumptions about the length and range of the returned data. For example: when our data source lacks some data, it may cause missing fields. In high latitudes area, there may be no sunrise or sunset on a certain day. Weather conditions may add new codes. When our functions are upgraded, it is possible to add new fields or parameters in the data return. Therefore, you must consider how to deal with those issuse in your program.
