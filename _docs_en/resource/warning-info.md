## Supported Regions

Weather warnings are not available for all cities, we will continue to expand these data, currently QWeather supports the following countries or regions.

> You can use the `range` parameter to get a list of all warning cities for that country or regions via [Warning City List API](/en/docs/api/warning/weather-warning-city-list/).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>ISO 3166-1</th>
      <th>Countries or Regions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  {%- assign warning_regions = site.data.regions | where: "isWarning", true -%}
  {%- assign name = "name-" | append: page.lang -%}
  {% for item in warning_regions %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ item.alpha-2 | downcase  }}</td>
      <td>{%- if page.lang == "zh" -%}{{ item.name_zh  }}{%- else -%}{{ item.name_en  }}{%- endif -%}</td>
    </tr>
  {% endfor %}  
  </tbody>
</table>

## Warning Level

Warning levels may vary by country and region. For mainland China, white (Guangdong Province only), blue, yellow, orange, and red are used. For Hong Kong(SAR China), yellow, red and black are used. For Macau(SAR China), blue, yellow, orange, red and black are used. For other countries and regions, green, yellow, orange and red are available.
