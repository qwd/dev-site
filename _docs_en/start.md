## SDK

If you are developing a mobile APP, then you can use our weather SDK directly for quick integration and out-of-the-box use.

#### System Requirements

iOS 8.0+ or Android 4.4+

#### Development

For configuration and development, please refer to [iOS SDK documentation](/en/docs/ios-sdk/) or [Android SDK documentation](/en/docs/android-sdk/)

> Weather SDK is currently unlimited calls for developers

## Weather Widget

Don't want to write any code? Try our [Free Weather Widget](https://widget.qweather.com/en/), which supports both web and mobile APP. The web widget provides simple configuration with a single mouse click, and the mobile SDK provides a variety of custom styles and layouts.

Below is an example of the [Standard Widget](https://widget.qweather.com/en/create-standard/), you can copy the following code to your web page to view. ÔºàUse your own KEY please.Ôºâ

```html
<div id="he-plugin-standard"></div>
<script>
WIDGET = {
  "CONFIG": {
    "layout": "1",
    "width": "400",
    "height": 150,
    "background": "3",
    "dataColor": "FFFFFF",
    "borderRadius": "8",
    "key": "7fae2c9a8f5e4c2f9af47941395c4880"
  }
}
</script>
<script src="https://widget.qweather.net/standard/static/js/he-standard-common.js?v=2.0"></script>
```

## Open Weather Plus

Open Weather Plus (OWP) is an open source weather APP and provides several ways to customize the style, making it easy to create a weather APP of your own.

- [Documentation for iOS](/en/docs/owp/owp-for-ios/)
- [Documentation for Android](/en/docs/owp/owp-for-android/)

> OWP uses Amap SDK for positioning by default, so you need to apply an Amap appkey by yourself
