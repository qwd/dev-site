## Finance and Cost

### What is Pay as you go?

Standard subscriptions use a pay as you go (a.k.a volume-based) pricing model that doesn't need you to pay a lot of money up front or for services you don't use - you only pay for you actually use. When you stop using it, you don't need to pay anything else. 

In addition, pay as you go pricing is a tiered price, meaning that the more you use, the lower the unit price. Please refer to [Pay-as-you-go Pricing](/en/docs/finance/pricing/) and [Billing System](/en/docs/finance/billing-and-payment/).

### What is subscription?

The subscription is a service model, similar to when you subscribe to a newspaper or magazine, and you have continuous access to the service for the duration of the subscription. QWeather Develop Service now uses a subscription model, offering Standard subscription, Pro subscription and Free subscription. Refer to [Subscription](/en/docs/finance/subscription/).

### What is billing?

Billing is the core of the QWeather finance system. All billable items will be integrated into the billing and users will pay according to the billing amount. The billing is also a legally valid agreement between you and us, we will provide you with services based on the contents of the billing and charge you based on the billing amount. Please refer to [billing and payment](/en/docs/finance/billing-and-payment/).


### What is Savings Plan?

The Savings Plan is designed to cover the cost of standard subscription and is a discount plan for users with a high volume of data requests. It is not dependent on specific data and only requires the user to commit to an annual amount to get a large discount. Compared to pay as you go billing cost, the Savings Plan can save 40%-70%.

### What is a request?

When you access our service through an API or SDK and get data, it is called a data request. A request is counted as one request no matter how much content is retrieved. If the status code of the response is non `2xx`, the number of requests will not be counted, but incorrect requests that exceed a reasonable range will have the account suspended.
