**Project** and **Credential** are important configuration for QWeather API, this document will introduce how to set up them.

## Project

**Project** is the container for QWeather API, which can also be understood as a product you need to develop, such as a "travel app" or a "graduation design".

**Credentials** are used for API authentication, which include the Ed25519 key (for JWT authentication) and the API KEY. We recommend creating separate credentials for various usage scenarios, such as “For Website” or “Test Only”.

5. Click "Create" button.

### Setup restrictions

You can restrict the use of credentials to higher levels of security. See [Security Restrictions](/en/docs/best-practices/security-guidelines/#security-restriction).
