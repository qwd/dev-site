You need to give attribution for products that use the our service. For example, if you have a page in your app that shows weather data from us, you should display something like "Weather service powered by QWeather" on that page.

## Attribution requirements

If you use our services in your products (such as APP, website, etc.), you need to clearly display our name: **QWeather**, and add URL `https://www.qweather.com`. We recommend as follow:

```
Weather service by QWeather
```

In addition, if you use the following data, you need to add additional source information.

**Weather Warning**

You must display all contents of `refer.sources` in your products that use weather warning data, and cannot modify this content in any way.


## Attribution style

There are no explicit requirements regarding the style of attribution, but please follow the guidance below:

- **Visibility:** Please ensure that the attribution is visible, the font style, font size or color is not too difficult to read.
- **No confusion:** Attribution should be placed separately, not mixed in with the content of your product, or misleading. For example, "Weather Services by QWeather" should not appear in a paragraph in the body of the page, or next to an advertisement (to avoid the misinterpretation that the advertisement is provided by the source).
- **Non-offensive:** In the context of attribution, content that is offensive or likely to be offensive or negatively impact the source should not appear.

## Exceptions

If you are using our separate commercial license, the terms of this document may not apply, or if your product can not display the attribution on a particular device, please contact us to discuss how to deal such exceptional circumstances.
