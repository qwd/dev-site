In order for developers to use QWeather services more fairly and compliantly, you need to agree to our various terms of service and restrictions. In this document, we will list some common usage restrictions and explanations for better understanding.

## Non-compliant products

Your product (e.g. APP or website, etc.) uses all QWeather services, it must comply with Chinese laws and regulations, otherwise your account will be suspended.

Refer to [Developers Terms of Service - Section 4.1](https://www.qweather.com/en/terms/developers-tos).

## Invalid requests

When your data response is not `code=2xx`, you should check your program as this is an invalid request. For all invalid requests, if it exceeds a reasonable range, it will be regarded as an attack on our services. At this time, you may no longer be able to use our service or your account will be suspended.
