QWeather Developer services are all based on pay-as-you-go billing model, you only pay for the services you actually use, no large upfront, no hidden fees, start and stop whenever you want, and no fees when you stop.

Pay as you go is tiered pricing model, with the higher requests, the lower cost per request.

## Specifications 

- **Billing unit:** pre request. See [What is a request](/en/help/#what-is-a-request).
- **Billing cycle:** monthly
- **Accrued charges cycle:** hourly
- **Tiered price progression cycle:** monthly
- **Minimum billing amount:** ¥0.01. Under ¥0.01 will be billed as ¥0.01

> **Example:** you have 1,000,000 requests per month, the monthly cost is: (50,000 requests x ¥0) + (950,000 requests x ¥0.0007) = ¥665
>
> *Note: this is an approximation and the final cost may vary slightly due to the actual request volume per hour.*

## Pricing

Pay-as-you-go is tiered pricing model, with tier requests calculated as the sum of the equests for each data item in the price groups. It is recommended that you use the [Price Calculator](https://console.qweather.com/price-calculator) to see the calculation process and estimate the monthly cost.

[Savings plans](/en/docs/finance/savings-plans/) can significantly reduce the cost.

> **Note:** When your average daily request volume is over **1,000,000** (or **500** for solar irradiation), please email <sales@qweather.com> and our business experts will provide a more flexible and cost-effective solution for you.
