QWeather Develop services are all based on pay as you go billing model, you only pay for the services you actually use, no large upfront, no hidden fees, start and stop whenever you want, and no fees when you stop.

Pay as you go is tiered pricing, with the higher requests, the lower cost per request.

## Specifications 

- **Billing unit:** pre request. See [What is a request](/en/help/#what-is-a-request).
- **Billing cycle:** monthly
- **Accrued charges cycle:** hourly
- **Minimum billing amount:** ¥0.01. Under ¥0.01 will be billed as ¥0.01

> **For example:** you have 1,000,000 requests per month, the monthly cost is: (300,000 requests x ¥0.001) + (700,000 requests x ¥0.0009) = ¥930

If you will continuously use our service, you can purchase [Saving Plans](/en/docs/finance/saving-plans/) to significantly reduce the cost.
