Or it can be understood that you paid ¥1,000 for about 1.6 million requests by default and will get about 2.5 million requests with purchasing a Saving Plans.

## Commitment Amount

The commitment amount is the amount you commit to use within one year, which will expire after 1 year or when it is used up, refer to [Expiration](#expiration). The bill amount for API requests will be paid using the commitment amount in priority.

## Commitment Terms

## Saving Rate

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| At 2022-12-30 23:00, the full committed amount is used up, and requests from the next hour will no longer enjoy the Saving Plans discount. | At 2023-03-19 23:59:59, there is a remaining commitment amount ¥234 in the Saving Plans, then from 2023-03-20, the remaining ¥234 will be invalid and can no longer be used. |

## Effective

The Saving Plans will be available immediately on the current hour of purchase.

> **For example:** You successfully purchased a Saving Plans at 14:30 on March 20, 2022, all data requests starting at 14:00 on March 20, 2022, will be calculated according to the Saving Rate.

## Discount Rules

Saving Plans are charged according to the corresponding Saving Rate, and discounts are no longer available when the Saving Plans expires or the commitment amount is used up.

> **For example:** If you purchase a Saving Plans with ¥1000 commitment amount and the Saving Rate = 0.7, so the price of real-time weather is: ¥0.0007 per request x 0.7 = ¥0.00049 per request. Within one year, if more than ¥1,000 has been used, the price of real-time weather is: ¥0.001 per request.
