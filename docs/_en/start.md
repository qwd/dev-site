Before requesting data, you need to create a project/credential, and do some simple configuration. See [How to configure the API and SDK](/en/docs/configuration/).

## Authentication

QWeather provides two [Authentication methods](/en/docs/configuration/authentication/): [JWT (JSON Web Token)](/en/docs/configuration/authentication/#json-web-token/) and [API KEY](/en/docs/configuration/authentication/#api-key/). we recommend JWT for higher level security.

## Coding

Also, here are some common practices and experiences when using our services so you can get the data quickly and easily. See [Best Practices](/en/docs/best-practices/).

QWeather Develop services are all based on pay as you go billing model with tiered pricing, you only pay for the services you actually use, no large upfront, no hidden fees, start and stop whenever you want, and no fees when you stop.
