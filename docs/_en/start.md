Welcome to QWeather Developer Services, this document will introduce some basic concepts for getting started and understanding how we work.

## Account

You will need to [register for an account](https://id.qweather.com/#/register?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.qweather.com) to manage your projects, credentials, finances, etc. Learn more about [Account](/en/docs/account/). 

## Configuration

Before requesting data, some preparations are needed:

- Create [projects and credentials](/en/docs/configuration/project-and-key/) to manage your API.
- Learn about [authentication](/en/docs/configuration/authentication/). QWeather supports two authentication methods: **JSON Web Token (JWT)** and **API KEY**.
- Obtain the [API Host](/en/docs/configuration/api-host/), which is your dedicated API domain name.
- Learn [how to send API requests](/en/docs/configuration/api-config/).
- Install and setup the [iOS SDK](/en/docs/configuration/ios-sdk-config/) or [Android SDK](/en/docs/configuration/android-sdk-config/).

## Coding

We provide detailed [Development Documentation](/en/docs/api/) and [Useful Resources](/en/docs/resource/), which can help developers do their work more efficiently.

Also, here are some common practices and experiences when using our services so you can get the data quickly and easily. See [Best Practices](/en/docs/best-practices/).

## Finance

QWeather Develop services are all based on pay as you go billing model with tiered pricing, you only pay for the services you actually use, no large upfront, no hidden fees, start and stop whenever you want, and no fees when you stop. See [Pricing](/en/docs/finance/pricing/) and [Billing and Payment](/en/docs/finance/billing-and-payment/).

If you have a high volume of requests, you can also use saving plans to significantly reduce your costs, learn about [Savings plans](/en/docs/finance/savings-plans/).

For users in mainland China, prices include VAT, if you need to issue a VAT invoice please refer to [VAT invoice](/en/docs/finance/vat-invoice/).
