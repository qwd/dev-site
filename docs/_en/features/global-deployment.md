## Global Acceleration

Behind your access to `api.qweather.com`, there are 10 data centers and hundreds CND nodes around the world for QWeather, which allows your Apps to get weather services fast and stable.

- **Automatic Routing:** No matter where your Apps is deployed, your data requests are automatically routed to the nearest data center.
- **Load Balancing:** When one data center fails or the load is high, your requests will be automatically assigned to the data center that is running normally, ensuring your Apps is always online.
- **CDN Edge Acceleration:** For regions without a data center, we will provide CDN edge acceleration capability for stable delivery of your requests.
- **Custom Data Center:** For enterprise developers, we offer to build dedicated data centers in specified countries or regions, which will greatly accelerate your local requests.
