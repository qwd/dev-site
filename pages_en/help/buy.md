## Package

For users with a high volume of data requests, it is recommended to purchase a Package to save the cost. Package is a prepaid product with a large discount for per-volume billing, discount up to 80%.
  
Calls Package is used to offset the data request of all Applications under your account, and Package for China Node will cover all requests within mainland China, Package for Overseas Node will cover all requests outside of China.

The Package will not affect the access to other data, which will still be charged on a pay-as-you-go basis.

> Package are valid for 12 months and can be purchased in stacks, giving priority to those purchased first. Package take effect immediately after purchase.
{:.bqwarning}

> For example, if you purchase real-time weather Package for 10,000,000 calls (China node), all Applications in the your account that do not exceed 10 million data request to the real-time weather within 12 months will not need to pay extra. If any calls that exceed that, or request to other data, or request from overseas will be charged according to the actual usage.

## Server Node

Due to the complexity of the Internet, the physical distance determines the speed of access. In order to solve this problem, QWeather has deployed server nodes in 10 countries around the world.

We support automatic global node routing, which allows users to automatically access the nearest server node via the optimal route without any configuration on your part, resulting in faster access speeds and higher connectivity rates.

For example, if you have users all over the world, when they use your product, they will access our global nodes nearby, thus reducing latency and avoiding connection errors.

For further suggestions on the location or selection of server nodes, please [contact us](https://www.qweather.com/en/contact).

## Outstanding Balance

When there is an outstanding balance status, the following happens:

* All Pay as You Go Applications cannot get data, annual and monthly paid Applications are not affected
* No invoice can be issued
* No refunds or withdrawals can be processed
* No new data Applications can be created

## Is the balance shown in real time {#balance} 

Approximate real-time amount, the balance is updated every five minutes, accurate to four decimal places.

## Billing

When you purchase weather data using the per-volume billing model, you can view your consumption bill in the consumption history in the Console. The minimum time granularity of the bill is hourly, and you can also check the total amount spent by day or by month.

Billing is calculated based on the amount of all data KEY calls under your data application.

The bill is generated every hour and records the total number of requests you used and the amount spent in the previous hour. There is some latency, so the bill and the balance you see in the Console will be different.


## Top-up

To purchase the weather data service on a volume-based basis, you need to top-up first. Top-ups can be using Alipay (support debit card, Alipay balance or credit card) or the company transfer.

> If you use company transfer to top up, you cannot withdraw or refund
